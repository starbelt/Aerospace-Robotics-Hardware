"""
Example of how to connect to a motion capture system and feed the position to a
Crazyflie, using the motioncapture library. The motioncapture library supports all major mocap systems and provides
a generalized API regardless of system type.
The script uses the high level commander to upload a trajectory to fly a figure 8.

Set the uri to the radio settings of the Crazyflie and modify the
mocap setting matching your system.
